    "description": "The mission of the Charles River Chorale is to bring a variety of engaging, enriching, and enjoyable choral music to the regional community. This welcoming chorus, under the professional direction of Ashley Nelson-Oneschuk, learns and performs a variety of repertoire and meets once a week for two hours, preparing two concerts per year. Although it remains centered in Millis, the Chorale has attracted members and audience from throughout the Charles River watershed area. Medway and Franklin are both well represented, and members travel from as far as Boston and Attleboro to sing with the organization.",
